University of Portsmouth
A New Platform

After thirty years of development, The Web comprises thousands of independently evolving technologies, millions of active developers and billions of users worldwide.

The Web permeates all societies;  it powers, integrates with, or supports, almost every computer system in use today.  It is arguably the most important platform in computing history, and the most important invention since the wheel.

Our aim is to pass on the knowledge, skills and inspiration necessary for you to take maximum advantage of The Web's world-changing potential.
