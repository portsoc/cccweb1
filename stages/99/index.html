  </header>

  <p>After thirty years of development, The Web has become a stack of hundreds of independently evolving technologies driven by millions of developers and billions of users worldwide.

  <p>The web permeates all societies;  it powers, integrates with, or supports, almost every computer system in use today.  It is arguably the most important platform in computing history, and the most important invention since the wheel.

  <p>Our aim is to pass on the knowledge, skills and inspiration necessary for you to take maximum advantage of The Web's world-changing potential.
